description: Learn how to disable indexing for specific pages on your app.

When disabling indexing for specific pages, you have a few options.

## useRobotsRule

The [useRobotsRule](/docs/robots/api/use-robots-rule) composable provides a reactive way to access and set the robots rule at runtime.

```ts
import { useRobotsRule } from '#imports'

const rule = useRobotsRule()
rule.value = 'noindex, nofollow'
```

## Route Rules

If you have a static page that you want to disable indexing for, you can use [defineRouteRules](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-route-rules) (requires enabling the experimental `inlineRouteRules`).

This is a build-time configuration that will generate the appropriate rules in the `/robots.txt` file and is integrated with the [Sitemap](/docs/sitemap/guides/robots) module.

```vue [pages/about.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
defineRouteRules({
  robots: false,
})
</script>
```

For more complex scenarios see the [Route Rules](/docs/robots/guides/route-rules) guide.

## Robots.txt

To configure blocked URLs using a [robots.txt](/docs/robots/guides/robots-txt) file, simply use the `Disallow` directive.

```robots-txt [robots.txt]
// public/_robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /my-page
Disallow: /secret/*
```

## Nuxt Config

If you need finer programmatic control, you can configure the module using nuxt.config.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  robots: {
    disallow: ['/secret', '/admin'],
  }
})
```

See the [Nuxt Config](/docs/robots/guides/nuxt-config) guide for more details.
