---

Nuxt Robots integrates with Nuxt Content out of the box. Allowing you to configure if
a page should be indexable or not right from your markdown files.

## Setup

Simply use the `robots: false` frontmatter key to opt out of indexing a page.

```md [content/foo.md]
---
robots: false
---
```

This will require that your markdown files have an associated path. When using [Document Driven Mode](https://content.nuxt.com/document-driven/introduction), all markdown files will automatically
have a path set.

Otherwise, you will need to make sure your markdown files have a `path` key.

```md [content/foo.md]
---
path: /foo
robots: false
---
```

### Requirements

The Nuxt Content integration does not currently work with the v3 of Nuxt Content. It also won't work when using deploying your site with Cloudflare.

It's recommended to manually disable to integration in these cases:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  robots: {
    disableNuxtContentIntegration: true,
  }
})
```

## How it works

This will add an entry to your `robots.txt` file that looks like this:

```robots-txt [robots.txt]
User-agent: *
Disallow: /foo
```

It will add the `X-Robots-Tag` header and `<meta name="robots">` tag to the page with the value of
[`robotsDisabledValue`](/docs/robots/api/config#robotsdisabledvalue).
